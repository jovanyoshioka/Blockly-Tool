A block-based coding literacy maze tool for K-5 teachers, whose schools may not have dedicated computer science programs, to integrate programming into their pre-existing curriculum, specifically their ELA courses. The tool generates mazes based on stories' plots for students to traverse using code. Students are able to advance not only their literary sequencing and comprehension abilities, but also their computer science skills in a challenging, yet fun way. Customizability is implemented as much as possible to adhere by teachers' specific needs.

Made using Google's Blockly open-source library.
