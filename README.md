A web-based application that integrates coding into existing K-5 English curriculum via challenges for schools that lack dedicated computer science programs. The challenges are mazes based on stories' plots that must be traversed using block-based code. Students are able to advance not only their literary sequencing and comprehension abilities, but also their computer science skills in a challenging, yet fun way. Customizability is implemented as much as possible to adhere to teachers' specific needs.

Code a Story is a part of Computer Science for Appalachia (CSA), an NSF-funded "research-practice partnership to integrate computer science into rural East Tennessee schools." For more information, visit: https://sites.google.com/vols.utk.edu/csa
