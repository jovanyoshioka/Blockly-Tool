A tool that generates mazes based on stories' plots to be traversed using block-based coding.
Created for K-5 teachers that do not have dedicated computer science programs in their areas to integrate computer science into their pre-existing curriculum, such as their ELA courses.

Made using Google's Blockly open-source library.
